# Python
My work with Python in my intro to programming class
This program processes the data in Inventory.txt using instances of the Inventory class. Each time a
customer purchases or returns an item, the program uses an instance of TransactionItem to store that information. When
a customer completes a transaction (a customer may both purchase and return items in the same transaction), the program
will display an invoice to the console, and create a new text file (UpdatedInventory.txt) with all inventory information
and updated quantities.
